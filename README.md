**Kindly ensure that you've gone through the site_nakuru notebook pdf, site_nairobi, and finally the decision site site_machakos notebook to get a full picture of how fragmentation and reconstruction has been done**

<br />
<br />



Create a distributed heterogeneous database environment comprising three sites with three different participating database platforms, and at least two different operating systems. Use the above environment to demonstrate your grasp of fragmentation and reconstruction.

Think of a domain area comprising of at least four distributed relations. Write out your applications/reports and use them to perform fragmentation. Come up with appropriate query access frequencies of your choice. Allocate the fragments by implementing them physically in the participating databases. Choose one of the sites to be the decision site and perform reconstruction using either views, functions, stored procedures or any other technique.

## Domain - Ecommerce

_The company Nitras is an online retailer that sells a variety of products, such as clothing, electronics, books, and home appliances. Nitras wants to use a distributed database to store and manage its inventory, orders, customers, and suppliers across 3 different counties. You have been hired as a consultant to design and develop the distributed database._

| Nairobi  | MySQL | Linux | 24.144.94.53 |

## Applications

- Application 1 - Find the name and price of the least ordered product in each store/branch
- Application 2 - Find the email and name of the customers who have ordered more than 10 times
- Application 3 - Find the total number of products in stock in for each supplier

### Application 1 - Find the name and price of the cheapest product in each category

Horizontally fragment the products table category wise

Simple predicates → `category`

Category = {Clothing, Electronics, Books, Toys, Furniture}

m1: Category = Clothing <br>
m2: Category = Electronics <br>
m3: Category = Books <br>
m4: Category = Toys <br>
m5: Category = Furniture <br>



```sql
--
-- Nakuru
--
SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE category_id = 2; -- Electronics

SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE category_id = 5; -- Furniture


--
-- Nairobi
--
SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE category_id = 1; -- Clothing

SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE category_id = 4; -- Toys


--
-- Machakos
--
SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE category_id = 3; -- Books
```

### Application 2 - Find the email and name of the customers who have ordered more than 3 times

Horizontally fragment the customers table orders wise

Simple predicates → `orders_count` > 3

m1: Orders_count > 3 <br />
m2: Orders_count <= 3 



```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE orders_count > 10;


SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE orders_count <= 10;
```

### Application 3 - Find the total number of products in stock in for each supplier

Horizontally fragment the inventory table supplier wise

Simple predicates → `supplier`

m1: Supplier = Supplier A <br />
m2: Supplier = Supplier B <br />
m3: Supplier = Supplier C <br />
m4: Supplier = Supplier D <br />
m5: Supplier = Supplier E



```sql
SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 1; -- Supplier A


SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 2; -- Supplier B


SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 3; -- Supplier C


SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 4; -- Supplier D


SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 5; -- Supplier E
```

## Query Execution Frequencies

|     | Machakos | Nairobi | Nakuru | Total |
| --- | -------- | ------- | ------ | ----- |
| Q1  |    0     |   8     | 8      | 16     |
| Q2  |     8    |   10     |  5     | 23     |
| Q3  |    0     |   15     |  7     |   22  |

## Reconstruction

These are the views that have been implemented in the decision site.

### category_cheapest


```sql
-- Active: 1706439060085@@127.0.0.1@5432@nitras

CREATE VIEW category_cheapest
AS

-- Create a subquery to get the lowest price for each category
WITH min_price AS (
  SELECT category_id, MIN(price) AS price
  FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_nakuru
    UNION ALL
    SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_nairobi
    UNION ALL
    SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_machakos
  ) AS inventory_all
  GROUP BY category_id
)

-- Join the subquery with the fragmented tables to get the name and price of the cheapest product in each category
SELECT i.category_id AS category, i.name AS item, i.price
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_nakuru
  UNION ALL
  SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_nairobi
  UNION ALL
  SELECT DISTINCT * FROM inventory_machakos
) AS i
JOIN min_price AS m
ON i.category_id = m.category_id AND i.price = m.price
ORDER BY i.category_id;

```

### triple_customers


```sql
-- Active: 1706439060085@@127.0.0.1@5432@nitras


CREATE VIEW triple_customers
AS
SELECT id, email, name FROM customers_orders_gt_3;
```

### supplier_products


```sql
-- Active: 1706439060085@@127.0.0.1@5432@nitras@public
CREATE VIEW supplier_products
AS
-- Combine the fragments using UNION ALL
WITH combined_inventory AS (
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_A
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_B
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_C
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_D
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM inventory_supplier_E
)

-- Calculate the total quantity for each supplier
SELECT
    'Supplier A' AS supplier,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_products
FROM combined_inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 1

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Supplier B' AS supplier,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_products
FROM combined_inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 2

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Supplier C' AS supplier,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_products
FROM combined_inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 3

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Supplier D' AS supplier,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_products
FROM combined_inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 4

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Supplier E' AS supplier,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_products
FROM combined_inventory
WHERE supplier_id = 5;

```
